			<dd>- The first recommendation is Knotted Donut. Knotted is famous donut shop in Seoul. Even Koreans stand in line to get this donut. There are various kinds of donut, such as cream donut, strawberry donut, chocolate donut, cinnamon munch donut, pistachio donut, and even cake. It has soft cream and delicious flavours.</dd>
			<dd>- Another food recommendation is London Bagel Museum.

This shop only is in Seoul so visit here to fully enjoy the taste of bagel that you have never tried before.</dd>

			<dd>- The most recommendation for Busan food is crab. Because of the region of Busan (locating near ocean), seafood is fantastic, especially crab and lobster. The sweet and salty flavour of crab melts in your tongue. It's light and go well with rice. Lobster in Busan is given to customers with cheese on top. The sweetness of cheese blends well with soft and creamy taste of lobster. Not only crab and lobster, they also have crab ramen in which they put crab in the ramen. Crabs help the ramen soup taste heavenly and rich. You should also try the side dish because the quality and taste is the same as the main dish. </dd>

			<dt style="color:papayawhip;">Jeju-Island Food</dt>
			<img src = "image\IMG_6790.png" alt = "Jeju-Island Food Photo1" width = "400" height = "600">
			<img src = "image\IMG_7016.png" alt = "Jeju-Island Food Photo2" width = "400" height = "600">
			<img src = "image\IMG_6788.png" alt = "Jeju-Island Food Photo3" width = "400" height = "600">
			<dd>- Hoppang is recommneded for food to eat in Jeju-Island. Hoppang is a white steamed bun and is usuall filled with red bean or vegetables. But, Jeju-Island hoppang is different. If you go to traditional market like Dongmun market or Olle market, they sell different types of hoppang. They have red bean, vegetables, cheese, pizza, bulgogi (Korean meat), or spicy squid inside hoppang. </dd>
			<dd>- If you love alcohol, try Hallasan soju (Korean alcohol drink) in Jeju-Island. South Korea has regional alcohol, and Hallasan is from Jeju-Island and sold in Jeju-Island. It's hard to see Hallasan soju other than Jeju-Island. It's unique and tastes good. It feels like your throat is getting clean. The alcohol taste is pretty strong, but the experience is worthwhile. </dd>
			<dd>- Last food to try is sashimi (sliced raw fish). Jeju-Island is known for fresh and delicious fish. You don't have to go far; buy sashimi in any local market and you won't fail. Sahimi in Jeju-Island is soft, fresh, and tasty and go well with gojuchang (Korean spicy sauce). </dd>
