				Seoul is the capitol city of South Korea, located in the western side. If you go to Seoul, you are going to be surprised by how Seoul has developed this much compared to the past. Skyscrapers, fancy restaurants, qualitative food, astonishing attraction, music, people, and even fast transportation. Seoul might seems to be developed city but it also has history components. Seoul has remained its past buildings, such as Hanok, and past palace where royals lived in.
