				If you ask Koreans to pick the "second" capital city, it would definitely be Busan. Busan is located in the south where ocean is nearby. Because of this region, Busan is famous for ocean, bridge, and beach. Busan is also developed city like Seoul with skyscrapers, restaruants, industries, and food; but the reason you should visit here is because of people. In South Korea, people speak slightly different language, a dialect based on their regions, and Koreans call this 'Satoori.' The accent and some words are slightly different and Busan is one of the region.
